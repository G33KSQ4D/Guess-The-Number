Created: August 12th, 2017

This is my first project in python.
Idea is from: https://knightlab.northwestern.edu/2014/06/05/five-mini-programming-projects-for-the-python-beginner/
I basically combined the first and second project (Not intentionally, it just happened that way)

This is my first project, so I didn't expect anything mind explosive. Just something so cover the basics and get me on 
my way to harder projects
