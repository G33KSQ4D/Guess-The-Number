I made this chatroom using Python libraries Sockets and Threading. The reason I first made this program was to be able to play
tic tac toe over the internet with a friend but some things just happened while I was codinga and I made a chatroom instead. 
I plan on updating it in the future by using GUI instead of text-based communications and maybe something else, not sure yet.

By the way, if in the rare case that someone downloads the scripts to test them, make sure that the server has port forwarding enabled
on the port that the socket is listening on and also make sure python.exe or whatever interpreter you're using can bypass the firewall
or else it won't work. Trust me, I went through hell trying to find out what my mistake was. So yeah,

1. Enable port-forwarding on port (I used 8000, to enable port forwarding I went to 192.168.0.1 (my router) and just changed a few things)
2. To allow python.exe (Interpreter to 'bypass' the firewall go to by searching 'Allow an app through the Windows Firewall' and go find 
Python.exe and click the checkmark.
